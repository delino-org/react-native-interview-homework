## Project Script/Setting
Here is our fake setting for the exercise:

We are building a new application around Online Food Ordering. The goal of the assignment is to create a searchable list on a page. Once user types at least 3 character the list will be searched and filtered by the word on search input. The word must be searched amongst both Title and Ingredients.
